She found herself making her way towards an empty seat next to him.\n        As the professor began the lecture, Bella couldn't help but steal glances at Edward. His striking green eyes met hers, and a small smile tugged at the corner of his lips. Bella blushed, quickly looking away, but she felt an electric connection that she couldn't ignore.\n        After the class, Bella found herself lingering behind, gathering her belongings slowly, hoping for a chance encounter with Edward. Just as she was about to leave, he approached her.\n        \"Hello,\" he said, his voice smooth and captivating. \"I couldn't help but notice you during the lecture. I'm Edward.\"\n        \"Bella,\" she replied, her heart racing. \"Nice to meet you, Edward.\"\n        They fell into an easy conversation, talking about their shared interests and ambitions. Bella felt an instant connection with Edward, as if they had known each other for a lifetime. They discovered a shared love for literature and a passion for exploring the city.\n        As the weeks passed, Bella and Edward spent more and more time together, discovering hidden corners of New York City and getting to know each other on a deeper level. Their conversations delved into their fears, dreams, and even their secrets.\n        It wasn't long before Bella realized that Edward was different. He possessed a grace and wisdom that extended beyond his years. When she finally discovered the truth '“ that Edward was a vampire '“ she didn't run away in fear but instead embraced him even more, fascinated by the extraordinary world he belonged to.\n        Their love story in the bustling streets of New York City was different from the one in Forks, but just as intense and profound. With the city as their backdrop, Bella and Edward forged a bond that transcended their individual worlds, proving that true love could flourish in any setting.",qas:[]}]}]}},"064d":function(e){e.exports={version:"v1.1",data:[{title:"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10832129/1/",Category:"Warcraft",index:"0000066",Writer:"Human",paragraphs:[{context:'I felt my body pushed against the tree, gently, but pushed.

Hailing from the great port city of Umbar, located in the southern lands of Middle-earth, the Corsairs were a formidable seafaring force that posed a constant threat to the realm of Gondor.\n        Born from the descendants of NÃºmenorean exiles who fell under the sway of Sauron, the Corsairs sought to assert their dominance over the seas and expand their influence. They became infamous for their piracy, raiding Gondorian vessels and coastal settlements, and pillaging the riches of the southern lands.\n        The Corsairs' allegiance to Sauron and their role as his maritime enforcers made them a formidable foe for Gondor. Their fleet of swift and deadly ships struck fear into the hearts of the coastal inhabitants, disrupting trade routes and challenging the authority of Gondor's naval forces.\n        Throughout the ages, the Corsairs launched numerous assaults against Gondor, seeking to weaken its defenses and exploit its vulnerabilities. They proved to be cunning adversaries, utilizing their knowledge of the treacherous coastlines and their mastery of naval warfare to their advantage.\n        Their most audacious and devastating attack occurred during the War of the Ring. Sensing an opportunity to strike while Gondor was preoccupied with Sauron's forces, the Corsairs launched a massive invasion, led by their formidable admiral, Castamir the Usurper.\n        The Corsair fleet, composed of heavily armed warships, descended upon Gondor's southern coasts, overwhelming the weakened defenses. The Corsairs' numbers and ferocity threatened to cut off Gondor's crucial supply lines and isolate the realm from reinforcements.\n        However, in a surprising turn of events, the true loyalty of the Corsairs was revealed. Aragorn, the rightful heir to the throne of Gondor, had gathered a mighty army and, with the aid of the dead men of Dunharrow, sailed up the Anduin River to confront the Corsairs.\n        As the Corsairs faced the terrifying sight of the Dead Men of Dunharrow, who fulfilled their ancient oath to aid Gondor in its time of need, their courage faltered. Overwhelmed by the supernatural terror of the dead, the Corsairs surrendered, realizing that their alliance with Sauron was doomed.\n        With the Corsairs' defeat, their fleet and the city of Umbar fell into the hands of Gondor once more.

According to a few things I found online, taking 1-5% of a child's blood is considered safe. So, 2.916 x .05 = 0.1458 pints (or .069 L or 69 mL since there are 1000 mL per L). Two tubes of blood = 20 mL. 20mL/1380mL = 1.4% of Harry's blood was taken.\nNot sure why I shared that with you guys, I thought it was interesting. I also like math every now and again. I also wanted to make sure that I didn't have the \"licensed doctor\" take too much blood that might endanger a child.\nFun fact: The adults reading this story have around 4.5-5.5 L of blood running through their bodies, which means you have about 3.6 times more blood than Harry. I thought that was pretty cool; it's amazing how much one grows in 14 years.\nHappy Reading,\nMichael",qas:[]}]}]}},"1b19":function(e){e.exports={version:"v1.1",data:[{title:"Write me a Pokemon fan fiction about a trainer who discovers a new type of Pokemon and has.csv",Category:"pok_mon",index:"0014443",Writer:"Gpt",paragraphs:[{context:"In the vast world of Pokemon, there was one trainer named Lily who was determined to catch and train every type of Pokemon out there.

Tales whispered through generations told of three powerful magical artifacts, each representing a different aspect of human existence'”power, resurrection, and the inevitability of death.\n        According to the oldest legends, the Deathly Hallows were first conceived by the enigmatic figure known as Death itself. As the story goes, three brothers ventured into a treacherous forest, where they encountered Death itself in the form of a hooded figure.\n        Seeking to outwit Death, each brother requested a boon. The first brother, a cunning and ambitious man, asked for the most powerful wand in existence, capable of overpowering any adversary. In response, Death granted him the Elder Wand, a weapon said to possess unparalleled power.\n        The second brother, driven by grief over the loss of a loved one, asked for a way to bring the dead back to life. Death, recognizing the futility of this request, bestowed upon him the Resurrection Stone'”a stone said to possess the ability to summon shades of the departed, but unable to truly resurrect the deceased.\n        Lastly, the third brother, wise and thoughtful, sought to evade Death's clutches altogether. He asked for an invisibility cloak that could shield him from Death's gaze. Impressed by the brother's cunning and humility, Death gave him the Cloak of Invisibility'”a garment said to render its wearer completely invisible.\n        As the tale spread, the artifacts became known as the Deathly Hallows, drawing upon the power of Death itself. Over time, they were believed to have been passed down through the ages, their whereabouts unknown, and their true potential shrouded in mystery.\n        Legends surrounding the Deathly Hallows captivated the imaginations of wizards and witches across the centuries, sparking both curiosity and fear. Many sought after the artifacts, believing that possessing all three would grant them unparalleled power and mastery over death itself.\n        As the legends grew, so too did the allure and danger associated with the Deathly Hallows. They became the subject of countless quests and pursuits, driving ambitious individuals to embark on perilous journeys in search of their hidden truths.\n        In reality, the Deathly Hallows remained elusive, their true nature known to only a select few throughout history. Their existence served as a cautionary reminder of the delicate balance between power, mortality, and the consequences of meddling with forces beyond mortal comprehension.\n        It was not until the fateful encounter between Harry Potter and Voldemort, and the revelation of their connection to the Hallows, that the true significance of the artifacts became clear. Their ultimate purpose was not to grant unlimited power or cheat death itself but to test the mettle of those who sought them, revealing the values and choices that defined their character.\n        In the end, it was Harry's decision to relinquish the allure of the Elder Wand and embrace the power of love that shattered the cycle of violence perpetuated by its possession. The Deathly Hallows, symbols of mortality and the human condition, became instruments of redemption and enlightenment, transcending their mythical origins to teach profound lessons about the nature of power, sacrifice, and the importance of embracing one's own mortality.\n        The legends surrounding the Deathly Hallows continue to captivate the imaginations of wizards and witches, their stories serving as reminders of the complexities of human existence and the enduring power of choice in shaping one's destiny.",qas:[]}]}]}},"33d3":function(e){e.exports={version:"v1.1",data:[{title:"Write me a lord of the rings fan fiction about How did the Blue Wizards aid in the war aga.csv",Category:"lord_of_the_rings",index:"0014365",Writer:"Gpt",paragraphs:[{context:"The Blue Wizards, or Ithryn Luin as they were called in Elvish, were two of the five wizards who were sent to Middle-earth by the Valar to help the peoples of the land to resist Sauron.

He was not only Frodo's faithful companion but also his protector and guide. Sam's unwavering determination and resourcefulness were the bedrock upon which Frodo leaned, enabling them to navigate treacherous landscapes and overcome insurmountable obstacles.\n        In moments of darkness, when Frodo's resolve faltered and the Ring's burden threatened to consume him, Sam's steadfast presence and unwavering faith provided the strength that Frodo needed to carry on. Sam's simple acts of friendship'”cooking a meal, sharing stories, or offering words of comfort'”reminded Frodo of the goodness and beauty that still existed in the world.\n        Their friendship was tested most severely in the depths of Mordor, where the weight of the Ring's influence bore down upon Frodo. Despite Frodo's attempts to push Sam away, fearing that he would succumb to the Ring's allure and bring harm upon his loyal friend, Sam's loyalty prevailed. He refused to abandon Frodo, vowing to stand by him until the end.\n        It was Sam's unwavering loyalty and selfless acts of bravery that ultimately saved Frodo from the brink of destruction. When Frodo's strength failed him at the precipice of Mount Doom, Sam stepped forward, carrying the burden of the Ring and offering Frodo a respite from its corrupting influence.\n        Their journey to destroy the Ring had taken its toll on both Frodo and Sam, physically and emotionally. Yet, their friendship endured. In the aftermath of their quest, Frodo recognized the invaluable role that Sam had played in their success. He acknowledged Sam's unwavering loyalty and declared him the true hero of their adventure.\n        Their bond would forever be cherished, and in the years that followed, Frodo and Sam remained close companions. Their shared experiences created a deep understanding and connection that transcended the trials they had endured. They carried the weight of their journey together, forever bound by the profound love and loyalty that defined their friendship.\n        The friendship between Frodo and Sam serves as a testament to the power of loyalty and selflessness. In the face of unimaginable challenges, they showed the strength of their character and the depth of their devotion. Their story resonates as a reminder that true friendship can overcome even the greatest of odds, lighting the way in even the darkest of times.",qas:[]}]}]}},"361b":function(e){e.exports={version:"v1.1",data:[{title:"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10769726/1/",Category:"Harry Potter",index:"0010939",Writer:"Human",paragraphs:[{context:"(I was hoping someone would ask how \"Time Travel\" in this story work, but here is the answer anyway, for any wondering about it.

In this community, Elara discovered strength and resilience, witnessing the power of unity in the face of adversity.\n        But Elara's quest for acceptance extended beyond her newfound companions. She endeavored to engage with the living, to show them that the Forsaken were not inherently evil, but individuals burdened by the sins of their past.\n        She volunteered her skills as a healer, tending to the wounded and sick, hoping to earn their trust through acts of selflessness. Through tireless efforts, Elara sought to dissolve the barriers between the living and the forsaken, to bridge the gap and foster empathy where there was once only fear.\n        Though her path was fraught with challenges, Elara encountered moments of genuine connection.

The walls of prejudice cracked, and tiny seeds of acceptance took root. The people of Lordaeron started to see her not as an enemy, but as an individual striving for redemption and connection.\n        Elara's journey became a beacon of hope for the forsaken, a testament to the power of resilience and compassion.

Where did you come by it?"\n        Bilbo looked down at the ring and smiled. "Oh, this old thing? I found it on my adventures, years ago. It\'s been a faithful companion ever since."\n        Gandalf raised an eyebrow. He had heard stories about Bilbo\'s adventures, of course, but he had never heard of this particular ring before. He leaned forward in his chair. "And what adventures were those, exactly?"\n        Bilbo launched into a tale of dragons and dwarves, of goblins and gold, and of a mysterious creature named Gollum who had once possessed the ring. As he spoke, Gandalf listened intently, his mind racing. Could this be the One Ring that he had been searching for, for so many years?\n        After Bilbo finished his story, Gandalf remained silent for a long moment, lost in thought. Finally, he spoke. "Bilbo, I have reason to believe that this ring of yours is more than just a simple trinket. It may be the One Ring of power that the Dark Lord Sauron has been seeking all these years."\n        Bilbo looked at Gandalf in shock. "What? The One Ring? That\'s impossible! I\'ve had this ring for years, and it\'s never caused me any harm."\n        Gandalf nodded gravely. "That may be true, Bilbo, but the power of the Ring is insidious. It corrupts even the strongest of wills, and in the wrong hands, it could bring about the destruction of Middle-earth. We must take every precaution to ensure that it does not fall into the wrong hands."\n        From that day on, Gandalf kept a close eye on Bilbo and the Ring. He knew that the fate of Middle-earth rested on his shoulders, and he was determined to do everything in his power to prevent Sauron from finding the Ring and using it to conquer the world. The journey that would eventually lead to the destruction of the Ring had begun, and Gandalf was at its forefront, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.',qas:[]}]}]}},4148:function(e){e.exports={version:"v1.1",data:[{title:"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10993346/1/",Category:"Lord of the Rings",index:"0005206",Writer:"Human",paragraphs:[{context:'Arwen moved her skirts to the side to ensure they were not in the way as Legolas sat further down the steps in front of her.

The destiny of the Ring and the fate of all who came into contact with it would have been altered forever.\n        Let us imagine a scenario where the Ring's discovery falls upon the shoulders of another inhabitant of the Shire, Frodo's cousin and close friend, Merry Brandybuck. As Merry stumbles upon the Ring in the depths of the Old Forest, its malevolent power seizes hold of him, much like it did with Bilbo.\n        In this alternate timeline, Merry becomes ensnared by the Ring's allure and secrets. Over time, its corrupting influence slowly seeps into his thoughts and actions, warping his once-kind heart into one consumed by greed and the lust for power. The Ring's dark whispers fuel his desires, driving him to exploit its immense power for his own gain.\n        Word of Merry's newfound possession spreads throughout the Shire, instilling fear and unease among the hobbits. They witness his transformation from a jovial and carefree soul into a shadow of his former self, his actions becoming increasingly unpredictable and dangerous.\n        Gandalf, recognizing the threat posed by the corrupted Merry, seeks to intervene. He forms a new fellowship, drawing together the remaining members of the original Fellowship, along with other wise and brave individuals from Middle-earth. Their mission: to confront Merry and wrest the Ring from his grasp before his corrupted desires wreak havoc upon the world.\n        The new fellowship embarks on a treacherous journey, facing countless perils and obstacles as they track Merry's movements throughout the Shire and beyond. The Ring's corrupting influence casts a dark shadow upon their path, testing their resolve and unity at every turn.\n        Merry, now a force to be reckoned with, gathers a host of followers who are drawn to the power emanating from the Ring. They become a formidable opposition, wreaking havoc upon the lands and spreading chaos in their wake. The free peoples of Middle-earth are faced with a dire threat, the likes of which they have never encountered before.\n        The ensuing conflict would be a battle not only against Merry and his forces but also against the relentless pull of the Ring itself. The fellowship must grapple with their own vulnerabilities and temptations as they confront the corrupted Merry, while also resisting the Ring's siren call that seeks to ensnare their own hearts.\n        Ultimately, the outcome of this alternate reality remains uncertain. The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as the forces of good struggle to reclaim the Ring and free Merry from its malevolent grip. The resilience of the fellowship and the choices they make will determine whether the light can prevail over darkness, and if the world can be saved from the clutches of this twisted new Ring-bearer.\n        In this alternate timeline, the story of Middle-earth would be one of darker shades, with the forces of evil gaining an advantage they had not enjoyed in the original tale. The heroes of the fellowship would face tremendous trials, both external and internal, as they strive to reclaim the Ring and restore balance to a world teetering on the brink of despair.",qas:[]}]}]}},"55fb":function(e){e.exports={version:"v1.1",data:[{title:"Write me Write a story about the daily lives of the Weasley family aft.csv",Category:"Harry_Potter",index:"0014348",Writer:"Gpt",paragraphs:[{context:"After the climactic events that unfolded in the wizarding world, the Weasley family settled into a new chapter of their lives, filled with love, laughter, and the comforting familiarity of their cozy home, The Burrow.\n        In the wake of the war, Molly and Arthur Weasley, the pillars of the family, dedicated themselves to rebuilding not just their own lives but also the wider wizarding community.

Though he understood the necessity of strength in the face of a hostile world, he began to question the morality of her actions and the toll they took on their own people.\n        Driven by a desire to free the Forsaken from Sylvanas's iron grip and restore their collective purpose, Victor assembled a group of like-minded Forsaken, those who shared his disillusionment with their current leadership. United by their desire for change, they conspired in secret, carefully navigating the treacherous web of Forsaken politics.\n        Their plan was intricate and multifaceted.

Through careful manipulation of information, they aimed to turn public opinion against her, sowing seeds of doubt among the Forsaken and their allies.\n        Victor knew that a direct confrontation with Sylvanas would be a fool's errand.

The streets of the Undercity erupted in chaos as loyalists clashed with dissenters, torn between their loyalty to Sylvanas and their longing for a better future.\n        The battle was fierce and bloody, but Victor's plot succeeded.

They ventured into treacherous lands, combating threats to the delicate ecosystems they held dear. Side by side, they fought against deforestation, corruption, and those who sought to exploit the natural world for their own gain.\n        In their travels, Rylan and Lyra encountered both beauty and tragedy. They witnessed the devastating effects of war and the fragility of life. They comforted each other in times of sorrow and celebrated their victories with shared laughter. Their friendship was a source of strength and solace in a world fraught with turmoil.\n        But it wasn't just their shared dedication to nature that brought them together'”it was their shared humanity, their ability to see beyond appearances and embrace the goodness within each other's hearts.

Rylan and Lyra bridged the gap between their races, demonstrating that understanding and compassion could overcome even the deepest divides.\n        As the years passed, Rylan and Lyra's friendship continued to thrive, their bond unbreakable. They remained guardians of nature, spreading their message of harmony and advocating for the protection of Azeroth's ecosystems. Their influence spread, inspiring others to set aside differences and work together for the betterment of the world.\n        Rylan and Lyra, the worgen and the night elf druid, became symbols of unity and understanding. Their friendship showed that through acceptance, empathy, and shared goals, beings from different walks of life could come together and forge unbreakable bonds.\n        And so, as they ventured forth into the ever-changing world of Azeroth, Rylan and Lyra stood as a testament to the enduring power of friendship and the transformative impact it could have, not only on their own lives but on the fate of the world they held dear.",qas:[]}]}]}},"5cd5":function(e){e.exports={version:"v1.1",data:[{title:"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10366223/1/",Category:"Harry Potter",index:"0005660",Writer:"Human",paragraphs:[{context:"Albus cursed himself for not paying any attention when Severus came to him with concern; he thought that Snape was being delusional and paranoid, but now… when all cards were down, old man understood how stupid and ignorant he had been.\nAfter several years of hiding from Grindewald who searched for Elder Wand, Garrick became the last of the Ollivander line and then… then, the accident made him impotent; Old families saw it as an opportunity to grab Ollivander's artefacts and research notes and to lesser extend money.\nWhen Garrick showed Jared Ollivander to the world, he told them he found a very talented boy in muggle orphanage.

Created by AulÃ«, the Valar of craftsmanship, the Dwarves were imbued with an unyielding spirit and an unquenchable thirst for mining and crafting treasures.\n        Their origin can be traced back to the awakening of Durin, the eldest and most renowned of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves. Durin awoke in the darkness of Mount Gundabad during the Years of the Trees, an age long before the rise of Men and Elves. He became the progenitor of the Longbeards, a mighty clan that would leave a lasting mark on the history of Middle-earth.\n        As the Dwarves multiplied and spread throughout the mountains and mines, they became skilled miners, unmatched craftsmen, and formidable warriors. They delved deep into the earth, discovering precious gems and ores, fashioning intricate works of art, and amassing great wealth.\n        Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, played a central role in the history of the Dwarves. The mountain, located to the east of the Misty Mountains, was once a thriving realm known as the Kingdom under the Mountain. It was founded by ThrÃ¡in I, a descendant of Durin, who led his people to Erebor in their pursuit of riches and a homeland.\n        Under the leadership of ThrÃ¡in I and subsequent kings, Erebor prospered. The Dwarves mined vast veins of gold and precious gems, fashioning magnificent treasures and building a glorious kingdom within the mountain's depths. The splendor of Erebor attracted the envy of dragons and the covetous eyes of other races.\n        The great dragon Smaug, drawn by the wealth of the Lonely Mountain, descended upon Erebor, driving the Dwarves from their homeland. For many years, Erebor lay under Smaug's thrall, its riches untouched and its halls desolate. The displaced Dwarves scattered across Middle-earth, yearning for the day they could reclaim their lost kingdom.\n        The quest for Erebor became a central focus for the Dwarves, particularly Thorin Oakenshield, the descendant of ThrÃ¡in II. He gathered a company of loyal Dwarves and set forth on a perilous journey to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and the treasure that lay within.\n        Their quest would bring them face to face with numerous trials and tribulations, including encounters with trolls, goblins, and the legendary dragon Smaug himself. With the aid of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who stumbled upon their adventure, the Dwarves managed to awaken the courage and unity needed to confront their greatest foe.\n        The Battle of the Five Armies marked a turning point in the Dwarves' quest. They, alongside their Elven and Human allies, faced off against the forces of evil in a desperate struggle for Erebor. Through bravery, sacrifice, and the leadership of Thorin Oakenshield, the Dwarves emerged victorious, reclaiming their ancestral home.\n        The restoration of Erebor signaled a new era for the Dwarves, a chance to rebuild their kingdom and once again thrive under the mountain's watchful gaze. With Thorin's passing, his cousin DÃ¡in Ironfoot assumed the mantle of King Under the Mountain, ensuring the Dwarves' legacy endured.\n        The history of the Dwarves and their quest for Erebor serves as a testament to their indomitable spirit, resilience, and unyielding determination.

These mystical orbs, crafted by the Noldor and gifted to the realms of the Free Peoples, held within them the power to perceive distant lands and communicate across vast distances.\n        The story begins in the city of Armenelos, the ancient capital of NÃºmenor, where one of the PalantÃ­ri was housed. The seeing-stone, known as Anor-Stone, was a cherished relic of the NÃºmenÃ³rean kings, granting them insight and wisdom. But as the darkness of Sauron's influence grew, the PalantÃ­ri became objects of temptation, capable of corrupting the hearts of those who gazed into their depths for too long.\n        As the downfall of NÃºmenor neared, the Anor-Stone was lost, sinking beneath the waves along with the realm it once served. Yet, the journey of the PalantÃ­ri had only just begun.\n        The PalantÃ­ri passed into the hands of the Faithful, those loyal to the Valar, who fled the sinking island and settled in Middle-earth. The surviving stones were distributed among the realms of Gondor and Arnor, becoming prized possessions and tools of guidance for their rulers.\n        Over the centuries, the PalantÃ­ri bore witness to the rise and fall of kingdoms, the ebb and flow of alliances, and the unfolding of great wars. They provided glimpses into distant lands, enabling the rulers of Gondor and Arnor to maintain contact, exchange vital information, and seek counsel in times of need.\n        But the journey of the PalantÃ­ri was not without its trials. Corruption, temptation, and misuse plagued some of these powerful artifacts. The stones, capable of revealing both truth and deception, held the potential to twist the hearts and minds of those who peered into them for too long.\n        In the waning days of the Third Age, as the shadow of Sauron's power spread across Middle-earth, the PalantÃ­ri played a pivotal role in the war against the Dark Lord. Their use became a delicate balancing act, as the lines between truth and manipulation blurred, and the minds of those who beheld them faced the ever-present risk of corruption.\n        In the final days of the War of the Ring, the PalantÃ­ri were instrumental in uniting the forces of the Free Peoples. With the aid of the stones, the scattered realms of Gondor, Rohan, and the remaining DÃºnedain coordinated their efforts, sharing vital information and bolstering their resolve against Sauron's forces.\n        Ultimately, as the darkness was vanquished and the war concluded, the PalantÃ­ri found their places of rest. Some were returned to their original locations, safeguarded and protected, while others were taken beyond the reach of mortal hands, hidden away from the world of Men.\n        The journey of the PalantÃ­ri, from the heights of NÃºmenor to the struggles of Middle-earth, showcased both their immense power and the inherent dangers they posed. They were objects of great temptation, capable of corrupting the hearts of even the most noble. Yet, in the hands of those who wielded them wisely, the PalantÃ­ri provided a means of communication, connection, and strategic advantage against the forces of darkness.\n        The tale of the PalantÃ­ri serves as a reminder that power, even when harnessed for noble purposes, can carry its own risks.

Its legacy, though marred by the passage of time, had a profound impact on the War of the Ring.\n        Arnor was founded in the early years of the Second Age, a sister realm to Gondor, with the noble intent to defend the lands of the Free Peoples against the forces of darkness. United under the High King, Arnor flourished as a beacon of hope and unity.\n        For centuries, Arnor stood strong against the encroaching darkness. Its people, known as the DÃºnedain, were renowned for their valor, wisdom, and foresight. The line of Isildur, the true heirs of the throne, ruled with a sense of duty and honor, protecting their realm from the perils that threatened to consume it.\n        However, over time, the kingdom of Arnor faced internal strife and external threats. The forces of evil, ever-present, sought to exploit the divisions within Arnor's noble lineage. As the High King's line faltered and fragmented, rivalries and power struggles weakened the unity of the realm.\n        The kingdom of Arnor fractured into three separate realms: Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. The bond that had once held the DÃºnedain together now lay shattered. This division played directly into the hands of the Dark Lord Sauron, who sought to reclaim the One Ring and plunge all of Middle-earth into darkness.\n        As the War of the Ring loomed on the horizon, the consequences of Arnor's fall became painfully evident. The fragmented realms lacked the unity and strength needed to withstand the onslaught of Sauron's forces. The absence of a united front against the Dark Lord created a strategic disadvantage for the Free Peoples.\n        Nevertheless, the remnants of Arnor fought valiantly against overwhelming odds. Aragorn, heir of Isildur and rightful King of both Arnor and Gondor, emerged from the shadows, rallying the forces of the Free Peoples in a final stand against Sauron's might. His presence reignited the spirit of Arnor, restoring hope to those who still believed in the kingdom's noble legacy.\n        The legacy of Arnor persisted in the hearts of the DÃºnedain, whose noble lineage could not be extinguished by the passage of time or the trials they faced. Their unwavering commitment to the cause of good and their courage in the face of darkness played a vital role in the War of the Ring.\n        Although the kingdom of Arnor had fallen, its legacy endured in the strength and determination of its people. The sacrifices made by the DÃºnedain, and the remnants of Arnor that fought alongside Gondor and other allies, helped tip the scales in the favor of the Free Peoples.\n        In the end, the tale of Arnor serves as a reminder of the importance of unity and the perils of division in the face of a common enemy. It shows the consequences of internal strife and the devastating impact it can have on a once-great kingdom.

This corrupted member, once a trusted ally, would have become a formidable adversary, their knowledge of the Fellowship's plans and weaknesses handed over to Sauron.\n        The presence of a traitor within their ranks would have caused discord and suspicion, straining the bonds of trust that held the Fellowship together. The remaining members would have found themselves constantly on guard, questioning each other's loyalty and motives. Unity, a vital strength, would be fractured.\n        The corrupted member, acting as Sauron's puppet, would have undermined the Fellowship's efforts at every turn. They could have leaked information, sabotaged crucial operations, or even directly attacked their companions, seeking to retrieve the Ring and deliver it to their dark master.\n        Sauron, with the aid of this traitor, would have gained a significant advantage in his quest to reclaim the Ring.

They would need to devise new strategies, relying on stealth, cunning, and unexpected alliances to outmaneuver the corrupted member and Sauron's forces.\n        Ultimately, the fate of Middle-earth would have hung in the balance, dependent on the resilience and resourcefulness of the Fellowship and their ability to navigate the treacherous path with a traitor in their midst. It would be a constant battle of wits, courage, and sacrifice against the overwhelming might of Sauron.\n        The outcome of this alternate reality is uncertain. The story would be one of darkness and despair, as the forces of evil would possess an advantage they had not enjoyed in the original tale.

The lush and tranquil landscapes of Thousand Needles had become the stage for a clash that would forever alter the delicate balance of power between the two factions.\n        The conflict arose from a series of misunderstandings and escalating hostilities, exacerbated by external forces seeking to stoke the flames of war. Rumors spread, mistrust festered, and soon the peaceful haven of Thousand Needles became a battleground.\n        It began with small skirmishes on the outskirts of the territory, but as the fighting escalated, the Horde and Alliance forces amassed, each determined to claim the land for their faction. The air crackled with tension as warriors prepared for a clash that would determine the fate of Thousand Needles.\n        Among the Horde, a battle-hardened orc warrior named Garok stood at the forefront. He had witnessed the horrors of war firsthand, and his heart burned with a desire for honor and glory. Garok firmly believed that the Horde's claim to the territory was justified and that victory would solidify their presence in Kalimdor.\n        On the side of the Alliance, an elven ranger named Elara led her forces. She valued diplomacy and sought a peaceful resolution, but as the situation escalated, she realized the need to defend her faction's interests. Elara knew that the Alliance's claim to Thousand Needles would ensure stability and protection for their allies in the region.\n        As the Horde and Alliance armies clashed, the serene landscape of Thousand Needles turned into a chaotic battleground. Blades clashed, spells exploded, and the earth trembled beneath the weight of the conflict. Lives were lost on both sides, and the once-thriving ecosystem of Thousand Needles suffered the scars of war.\n        But amidst the chaos, a glimmer of hope emerged. Garok and Elara found themselves face-to-face on the battlefield, their weapons poised to strike. In that critical moment, they saw the devastating consequences of their actions. The destruction, the loss of innocent lives, and the irreparable damage inflicted upon the land weighed heavily on their hearts.\n        With a shared realization, Garok and Elara stepped back from the precipice of violence. They recognized that the true enemy was not each other, but the cycle of hatred and vengeance that perpetuated the conflict. They saw the innocent beings of Thousand Needles caught in the crossfire, their lives shattered by a war they did not ask for.\n        In an unprecedented act, Garok and Elara called for an immediate ceasefire, urging their respective factions to lay down their weapons and seek a peaceful resolution. They argued that the land of Thousand Needles should remain a neutral territory, a place where both Horde and Alliance could coexist without bloodshed.\n        Their pleas struck a chord with the weary soldiers. The horror of the battle, the cries of the wounded, and the realization of the needless suffering touched the hearts of even the most hardened warriors. And so, against all odds, the Horde and Alliance forces reluctantly agreed to a truce.\n        Thousand Needles, once ravaged by the conflict, became a symbol of hope and reconciliation. Garok and Elara, with the support of wise leaders from both factions, worked together to restore the land, heal its wounds, and foster an environment of cooperation and understanding.\n        The clash in Thousand Needles served as a turning point, a catalyst for change. It opened the doors for dialogue and diplomacy, paving the way for future cooperation between the Horde and Alliance. The neutrality of Thousand Needles became a testament to the power of reconciliation and the possibility of finding common ground in even the most heated conflicts.\n        And so, in the aftermath of the clash, Thousand Needles transformed into a beacon of hope, reminding the denizens of Azeroth that peace, though fragile, could prevail even in the midst of bitter enmity.",qas:[]}]}]}},"8a42":function(e){e.exports={version:"v1.1",data:[{title:"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10191450/1/",Category:"Harry Potter",index:"0008805",Writer:"Human",paragraphs:[{context:"Thing was for sure.

Each scenario brought forth its own unique set of experiences and shaped Harry into a different person.\n        If Sirius Black had raised Harry, they would have formed an unbreakable bond, rooted in their shared grief and the love Sirius held for his best friend, James Potter. Sirius would have showered Harry with affection and taught him the importance of loyalty, bravery, and standing up for what is right. Under Sirius's guidance, Harry would have grown up surrounded by stories of his parents' courage and the values they held dear.\n        Living a life on the run from the Ministry, Sirius would have imparted his knowledge of the wizarding world, honing Harry's magical skills and teaching him to navigate the complexities of the dark times they found themselves in. The two would have become partners in their pursuit of justice, fighting against the remnants of Voldemort's followers and uncovering hidden truths.\n        In contrast, if Remus Lupin had raised Harry, he would have provided a calm and nurturing environment. Remus, despite his own struggles with lycanthropy, possessed a gentle nature and a deep understanding of the challenges Harry faced. He would have emphasized the importance of empathy, acceptance, and self-control, teaching Harry to embrace his inner strength and overcome adversity.\n        With Remus as his guardian, Harry would have had a different perspective on the world.

Remus would have instilled in Harry a deep respect for all magical beings, fostering an environment of understanding and compassion.\n        Both Sirius and Remus would have played a pivotal role in Harry's life, shaping his moral compass, teaching him the power of love and friendship, and guiding him on his path to becoming a true hero. Their influence would have provided Harry with a different set of skills and values, expanding his perspectives and molding him into a compassionate and resilient individual.\n        However, regardless of who raised him, Harry would still face numerous challenges and obstacles on his journey. The weight of his destiny as the Boy Who Lived would remain, and the ultimate battle against Voldemort would still loom ahead.\n        Whether guided by Sirius's fierce determination or Remus's quiet wisdom, Harry would continue to navigate the treacherous waters of the wizarding world, finding solace in the love and support of those who cared for him. His path might have been altered, but his resilience, bravery, and unwavering desire to protect his loved ones and fight against evil would remain unchanged.\n        In the end, it was Harry's indomitable spirit and the strength of the relationships he forged that propelled him forward, shaping his destiny and cementing his place in wizarding history as the one who triumphed over darkness and brought about a new era of peace and unity.",qas:[]}]}]}},"8b13":function(e){e.exports={version:"v1.1",data:[{title:"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10557230/1/",Category:"Warcraft",index:"0000070",Writer:"Human",paragraphs:[{context:'The ship has arrived at Stormwind.

However, his heart yearned for the open skies and unexplored lands. Sensing his restlessness, King Thranduil granted him leave to explore the world beyond the forest, bidding him to represent the Elves in the wider realms.\n        Gimli, on the other hand, returned to the kingdom of Erebor, where he played a pivotal role in rebuilding the grand halls of the Dwarves. His knowledge of stonework and craftsmanship proved invaluable, and he was hailed as a hero by his kin. Yet, his thirst for adventure burned brightly, and he longed to traverse new lands and discover hidden treasures.\n        United by their wanderlust, Legolas and Gimli set forth on a series of extraordinary journeys, venturing far and wide across Middle-earth. They sought to deepen their understanding of the lands and peoples they had fought alongside during the War of the Ring.\n        Their travels took them to the far reaches of the map, from the elven havens of LothlÃ³rien and Rivendell to the ruins of ancient kingdoms and the unexplored wilderness. They encountered a diverse array of beings, both friend and foe, and exchanged stories and knowledge, fostering bonds of friendship and understanding between their peoples.\n        Their adventures also brought them to the distant shores of Harad and beyond, where they encountered cultures vastly different from their own. Legolas shared the beauty and wisdom of the Elves, while Gimli showcased the indomitable spirit and craftsmanship of the Dwarves.

Their bond between Elf and Dwarf, once thought impossible, became a symbol of unity and cooperation, reminding the world that the true measure of a person lies not in their race or background but in their deeds and character.\n        Though their individual tales are no longer recorded, the memory of Legolas and Gimli lives on, immortalized in the songs and tales of Middle-earth.

As a child, he witnessed the devastating consequences of battle'”the loss of loved ones, the destruction of homes, and the relentless cycle of violence. Determined to break free from this cycle, Durok sought a path of honor and unity.\n        Guided by the wise words of his elders, Durok embraced the teachings of his shamanic heritage, recognizing the interconnectedness of all life and the power of unity in the face of adversity. He devoted himself to the study of the elements, finding solace and guidance in the elemental spirits that whispered through the winds and flowed through the earth.\n        As Durok grew older, he ventured beyond the confines of his shattered homeland, seeking to heal the wounds of the past and foster unity among the fractured orc clans. With every step, he encountered individuals and communities grappling with their own post-war struggles, haunted by memories of loss and grappling with the weight of rebuilding.\n        Durok listened to their stories, offering a sympathetic ear and words of wisdom drawn from his shamanic teachings. He became a beacon of hope, inspiring others to rise above the scars of war and work towards a future built on understanding, compassion, and cooperation.\n        His journey brought him to lands scarred by the conflicts of the past, where he faced challenges and trials that tested his resolve. Through these hardships, he honed his skills, his character, and his unwavering commitment to the pursuit of peace.\n        But Durok's coming-of-age was not without its personal struggles. He confronted the darkness within himself'”the anger, the hatred, and the desire for revenge that threatened to consume him. Through introspection and the guidance of the elemental spirits, he learned to temper these emotions, channeling them into a force for positive change rather than destruction.\n        Durok's actions did not go unnoticed. Others began to rally around his cause, joining him in his quest for unity and peace. Orcs, humans, trolls, and other races stood side by side, embracing the vision of a world where differences were celebrated, not feared.\n        Over time, Durok's efforts yielded tangible results. Communities healed, alliances formed, and the scars of war began to fade, replaced by the vibrant tapestry of a post-war Azeroth. Durok's coming-of-age story became intertwined with the collective narrative of the world, a testament to the indomitable spirit of the orcish people and the transformative power of unity.\n        In the end, Durok's journey was not just about personal growth; it was about shaping the destiny of a world in transition. His actions helped forge a path towards reconciliation, reminding all who witnessed his journey that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope for a brighter future.\n        And so, the young orc Durok emerged from the crucible of war as a symbol of resilience, compassion, and the unwavering belief that unity could overcome the deepest divides.

These stories, passed down through generations, offer glimpses into the rich and vibrant cultures that once thrived in the realms of the Elves.\n        Among the Elven kingdoms, the city of Gondolin stands as a shining jewel, hidden in a secret valley and protected by enchantments. The tale of Gondolin recounts its creation by the Elven lord Turgon, its breathtaking architecture, and the tragic events that led to its downfall. The story paints a vivid picture of a majestic city filled with soaring towers, beautiful gardens, and a sense of ethereal wonder.\n        Another tale whispers of Doriath, the kingdom ruled by King Thingol and Queen Melian. In this enchanted realm, the Elves flourished under the protection of the Girdle of Melian, a magical barrier that shielded the land from intruders. The story reveals the love between Thingol and Melian and the enchantment of the fabled Silmaril, which brought both joy and great tragedy to their kingdom.\n        The tale of Nargothrond tells of Finrod Felagund, a noble Elven prince who built a mighty underground fortress, rich with treasures and guarded by stalwart warriors.

With a mind brimming with ideas and an insatiable thirst for invention, Gizmo sought to push the boundaries of gnome engineering to new heights.\n        From a young age, Gizmo had been fascinated by gears, gadgets, and all things mechanical. While other gnomes played games or pursued traditional gnome professions, Gizmo spent countless hours tinkering in his workshop, assembling contraptions and experimenting with wild inventions.\n        However, life as an engineer was far from easy. Gizmo faced numerous setbacks and challenges along the way. His early creations often malfunctioned, leading to comical mishaps and occasional explosions. The other gnomes would chuckle at his failed attempts, dismissing his ideas as mere whimsy.\n        Undeterred by the ridicule, Gizmo persisted, driven by an unyielding determination to prove himself. He honed his engineering skills, studying ancient tomes and seeking the guidance of renowned gnome inventors. With each setback, he learned valuable lessons, discovering new techniques and refining his designs.\n        Gizmo's first major breakthrough came when he invented a pair of mechanical wings, enabling him to soar through the skies of Dun Morogh. The gnomish flying apparatus, as he called it, garnered attention and admiration from fellow engineers and adventurers alike. It was a symbol of Gizmo's unwavering spirit and his ability to overcome adversity.\n        As Gizmo's reputation grew, so did the challenges he faced. He was approached by wealthy patrons and organizations with impossible engineering tasks. He was tasked with designing intricate security systems, constructing massive siege engines, and even developing a device capable of harnessing the raw energy of Azerite.\n        With each new project, Gizmo's skills were put to the test. He toiled tirelessly, pouring his heart and soul into every creation. The pressure mounted as deadlines loomed, and failure was not an option.\n        But Gizmo's greatest test came when Gnomeregan itself faced a crisis. The city, once a beacon of gnome engineering, had fallen to troggs and had been overrun with radiation. It was a shell of its former glory.\n        In the face of despair, Gizmo rallied his fellow engineers, leading them in a daring mission to reclaim their city. He devised ingenious gadgets and devised strategies to outsmart the trogg invaders. With his quick thinking and inventive solutions, Gizmo and his team pushed back the troggs, inch by inch, reclaiming Gnomeregan piece by piece.\n        Through his unwavering determination and resilience, Gizmo emerged as a symbol of hope for the gnome community. He inspired a new generation of engineers, showing them that failure was merely a stepping stone to success, and that innovation could overcome even the greatest of challenges.\n        As Gnomeregan was gradually restored, Gizmo's reputation soared to new heights. He became a renowned inventor, his name spoken with awe and respect across Azeroth. He was celebrated for his contributions to engineering and revered as a hero among his fellow gnomes.\n        Yet, despite his fame, Gizmo remained humble, always eager to share his knowledge and assist aspiring engineers. He knew that the true measure of success lay not in personal achievements, but in the impact he had on others and the legacy he left behind.\n        And so, Gizmo Geargrinder continued to push the boundaries of gnome engineering, leaving a trail of innovation and inspiration in his wake.

He respected yet feared her. Almost everyone had, but that didn't change anything. In the end, she was still human and when her day came Giovanni found himself dreading what was to come. His inheritance. He always knew the day would come, when he would have to face what his mother had prepared him for all his life, but half of him had hoped the day would never come.\nAll at once, all the members of Team Rocket stood before him. They all turned to him, awaiting his orders. And that's when he realized the truth. He had obeyed her orders and followed her plans for all these years, because he had pitied her. She had lived her whole life for her work. His father had left her when Giovanni was a child. It couldn't be said that she ever really took care of Giovanni. It had always been grunts or the servants. She had missed his whole life and now that she had passed there was nothing.\nNothing but Team Rocket. It was her legacy. The only proof of her existence. If he had let it go, his mother would have lived and died for nothing. The powerful woman he had fear and respected would be nothing, but a hollow illusion. And so he left the life he had built behind, put on an ill fitting suit and accepted a possession that never really suited him anyways.\nAs his influence expanded, so did his greed, until it became a force almost unstoppable. He had sworn to build Team Rocket to greater heights then before. Build it day and night because it was all he had. Build it because otherwise, the illusion would vanish and he would finally be forced to open his eyes.\n8.

Honestly, the way I see beauty is through someone's character and not their physical appearance. I look at a person who may not be conventionally pretty, and find them to still be beautiful. So really, in my eyes, Valeria is already pretty, despite what other characters might think. I think it's sweet that you want Valeria to have an easier time at Hogwarts, but a beauty spell is just not feasible. On another note, I also find Valere's reactions to his daughters hilarious. Look forward to more. :)\nThink that's it.\nGood day,\n-Fiction\nPS. No, no, no, I will not be responding to the rest of the reviews tonight.

The looming threat of Sauron's forces and the temptation of power presented an agonizing choice: to join the Dark Lord or remain true to their nature as guardians of the forests.\n        Some Ent voices were swayed by the persuasive whispers of Saruman, the corrupted wizard who sought dominion over Middle-earth. They believed that by aligning with Sauron, they could preserve their territories and wield formidable strength against their enemies. It was a bitter betrayal of their purpose as protectors, but the allure of power clouded their judgment.\n        As the Ents united in their decision to join Sauron, trepidation spread across Middle-earth. The entwined branches of Fangorn Forest became a formidable fortress, a bastion for the Dark Lord's forces. The Ents' ancient knowledge of the forest allowed them to turn its natural resources into formidable weapons of destruction.\n        Sauron's armies marched alongside the Ents, spreading devastation wherever they went. Forests were razed, rivers poisoned, and the very balance of nature was thrown into chaos. The Ents, once gentle guardians, became ruthless agents of destruction, felling trees and laying waste to the lands in their path.\n        The free peoples of Middle-earth were caught off guard by this unholy alliance. The Elves mourned the loss of the ancient forests, while the Men and Dwarves struggled to comprehend the destruction wrought by their former allies. Even the powerful forces of Gondor and Rohan found themselves ill-prepared to face such a formidable adversary.\n        Yet, in the darkest of times, a glimmer of hope remained. A small group of Ents, led by the noble Treebeard, resisted the temptation to join Sauron's ranks. They clung steadfastly to their ancient oaths, refusing to forsake their kinship with the natural world and the free peoples of Middle-earth.\n        With their numbers greatly diminished, these loyal Ents launched a courageous campaign against their corrupted brethren. They fought valiantly, using their knowledge of the forests to wage a guerrilla war against the forces of darkness. The battle between the Ents became a struggle for the very soul of Fangorn Forest.\n        Ultimately, it was the enduring spirit and resilience of the Ents that prevailed. Through strategic strikes and relentless determination, they overcame their corrupted brethren, dispelling the darkness that had gripped their hearts.\n        The Ents, scarred by the memory of their misguided alliance, dedicated themselves to the restoration of the forests and the healing of the lands. They worked alongside the free peoples, using their vast knowledge of the natural world to rejuvenate the ravaged ecosystems and bring balance back to Middle-earth.\n        In time, the Ents' noble deeds and their commitment to preserving the beauty and vitality of the world served as an inspiration to all. The Ents became revered as guardians of nature and invaluable allies to the free peoples, forever reminding them of the importance of harmony between the land, its creatures, and the hearts of those who dwell within it.",qas:[]}]}]}},bd60:function(e){e.exports={version:"v1.1",data:[{title:"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10122147/1/",Category:"Pokémon",index:"0002812",Writer:"Human",paragraphs:[{context:'After the win against Max, Ash felt great, he was happy he got what he wanted revenge and though sadistically it isn\'t good to promote revenge he felt it was the right time for the feelings.

Gandalf's true power lay not in his strength or magic, but in his wisdom, guidance, and ability to inspire others to stand against the forces of darkness.\n        Saruman, initially a wise and respected leader, became consumed by his desire for power and knowledge.

After the War of the Ring, they gradually departed Middle-earth, their task complete, leaving behind a legacy of wisdom and guidance that would be cherished and remembered by future generations.\n        The story of the Istari reminds us that even in the face of overwhelming darkness, a few dedicated individuals can make a significant difference.

In his other hand was the small coat which the little girl he was looking at had shrugged off her shoulders at least three times now.\nThe coat she\'d refused would have been going on over her brand new school blazer, bright blue with the yellow school logo emblazoned onto the right breast. Her skin was a mid-tone brown, contrasting sharply against her bright pink wooly gloves and scarf, her hair pulled back tight into a pair of puffs which Wrathion had almost been as proud of as she had when he\'d first succeeded in styling them. Her boots and backpack were just as bright pink as the rest of her accessories, although the rest of her actual school uniform was a dull blue-grey.\nAnduin conceded and stood up with his teeth gritted, forcing a smile through the stabbing pain that shot through his knee even after all these years. "Alright, Tiffin. No coat today. But promise me you\'ll keep your jacket on?"\nThe four-year-old rolled her eyes. "Yeah.

With practiced ease, she prepared a delicious breakfast, blending flavors and textures into a masterpiece. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and warm pastries wafted through the house, drawing everyone's attention.\n        The family gathered around the large dining table, their faces illuminated with love and gratitude. Esme reveled in the warmth of their presence, cherishing the simple yet profound joy of being surrounded by her loved ones.\n        After breakfast, Esme ventured outside, her green eyes sparkling with a zest for life. The gardens surrounding the Cullen residence were her sanctuary, a canvas for her creative soul. She meticulously tended to the vibrant flowers, nurturing them with gentle care.\n        As she worked, Esme's thoughts turned to the world beyond the Cullen home. She couldn't help but feel a deep sense of empathy for those who were less fortunate. Determined to make a difference, she planned charitable endeavors, organizing donations and volunteering her time to help those in need.\n        In the afternoon, Esme indulged in her passion for art. She spent hours in her personal studio, surrounded by canvases, paints, and brushes. With each stroke, she poured her heart and soul onto the canvas, creating masterpieces that captured the beauty she saw in the world.\n        As evening approached, Esme joined her family for a calming twilight stroll through the forest. The serenity of nature enveloped them, and Esme reveled in the symphony of sounds'”the whisper of leaves, the distant call of wildlife'”each note a reminder of the interconnectedness of all living things.\n        Back at home, Esme gathered everyone for a family movie night. They laughed, cuddled together, and lost themselves in the magic of cinema. In those moments, Esme felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude for the love and harmony that filled their lives.\n        As the day drew to a close, Esme retreated to her sanctuary, her bedroom. She basked in the tranquility, reflecting on the day's moments of joy and purpose. With a contented sigh, she sank into the plush comfort of her bed, knowing that tomorrow would bring new opportunities to spread kindness and create beauty in the world.\n        For Esme Cullen, each day was a testament to the power of love, compassion, and the ability to find beauty in the simplest of moments. She embraced life with open arms, a beacon of warmth and nurturing for her family and those fortunate enough to cross her path.",qas:[]}]}]}},fafc:function(e){e.exports={version:"v1.1",data:[{title:"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10630826/1/",Category:"Pokémon",index:"0001737",Writer:"Human",paragraphs:[{context:'A team aqua grunt started screaming."Get lost kid!"\nI immediately replied in rebuttal.
